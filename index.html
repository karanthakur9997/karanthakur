      <h1>Our First Meet ☕</h1>
      <p>That first day we met at the little café will forever be etched into my soul. The air smelled of fresh coffee, but all I could feel was the magic between us. The world outside disappeared, leaving only you and me in our own perfect bubble, as if time itself had paused to witness our meeting.

We laughed like we had known each other for years, and every word you spoke made my heart beat faster. When our hands touched, it was like a spark that lit something deep within me. The moment I rested my head on your shoulder, I knew truly knew that I had found my safe place.

That day wasn’t just the start of our story; it was the birth of my forever. I didn’t just leave with beautiful memories, I left with your heart in mine and unknowingly, you carried mine away too. 💞</p>

      <h1>The Night You Said Yes To Be My Girlfriend 💕</h1>
      <p>The night of 9th August 2025 will forever live in my heart. At 1 AM, you asked me to call, and without a second’s delay, I did.We talked for 5 hours and 48 minutes, laughing, teasing, and exchanging countless “I love you’s.”
Somewhere in that magical conversation, my heart found the courage to ask what it had been longing to say “Will you be my girlfriend?”

You didn’t pause, didn’t hesitate. In an instant, you said “Yes,” and that single word filled my soul with warmth and joy I can’t describe.

It wasn’t about grand gestures or perfect scenes it was about two hearts speaking honestly in the quiet of the night.That “Yes” turned a simple call into the beginning of a forever story.

From that night on, I knew I had found not just my girlfriend, but my best friend, my love, and my safe place. 🌸</p>
